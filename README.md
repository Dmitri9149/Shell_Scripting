I like languages with high level constructs like Haskell, Links, Idris, Agda, JoCaml, Rust (in some extend in high level too). But if you wil try to install Links, or implement your Transformer for language translation, or make something real in cloud, you will finally face command line and shell scripts (for example in form of Docker reincarnation).

Here is collection of small shall scripts 'classical' (?? not sure all will be clssical, but anyway..) projects. This is running projects for the skills development.
